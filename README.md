## Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many people’s daily lives - we conduct most of our lives now at home and receive information from the media about how to stay safe. However, populations such as the elderly are unable to easily access information about COVID-19. Our solution to this problem was to create a simple smartphone application to predict one’s risk for COVID-19 complications and to recommend safe practices.

## What it does
This application takes into account one’s lifestyle information - age, exercise, and medical conditions to determine one’s risk for COVID-19 complications. It also advises on how to stay well both mentally and physically, as well as recommends activities of appropriate risk.

## How we built it
We built this using Android Studio for the frontend and Java for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
Only one of us had experience with coding before so we all had to learn how to use Android Studio. One of the main issues we had was with the UI, making it functional and look nice at the same time. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of completing this project with little to no prior experience using Android Studio within the strict timeframe of 24 hours. Through long hours of googling and troubleshooting, we managed to ship out an app that looks good and most importantly, does its job. 

## What we learned
One of the biggest takeaways from this project is understanding how to utilize GitHub and Android Studio while maintaining team cohesion. One problem that we overcame was with regards to splitting up jobs in a way so that we didn’t overwrite each other's work.

## What's next for Know Your Risk
In the future, we'd like to try adding more features, such as advisories based on location and the number of cases in that area, as well as adding notifications based on the government's announcements.
